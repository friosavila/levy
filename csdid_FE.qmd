First. Some other tools. Please copy [this](https://friosavila.github.io/stpackages/fra/fra.ado) file, run it, and type:

```stata
** just for data example
ssc install frause
** for installing csdid2
fra install fra
fra install csdid2
```

Now the example. 

First Run csdid with panel data

```{stata}
frause mpdta, clear
set seed 1
csdid lemp, ivar( countyreal) gvar(first) time(year)
```

Then, drop at randome 10% of the data, so technically have unbalanced panel. It can be estimated using repeated crossection

```{stata}
drop if runiform()<.1
** as Panel with unbalanced Data
csdid lemp,  ivar( countyreal) gvar(first) time(year)
```


```{stata}
** As RC
csdid lemp,  cluster( countyreal) gvar(first) time(year)
```

The second one produces odd results, which is not unexpected. 

Now using the residuals Idea:

```{stata}
** Getting residuals
reghdfe lemp, abs( year countyreal) resid
** AS RC but with residuals
csdid _reghdfe_resid, cluster( countyreal) gvar(first) time(year)
```

I think this produces much better results!
Not sure how would this translate in other frameworks, tho.
